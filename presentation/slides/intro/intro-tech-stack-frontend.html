// Notes

Our current technology stack looks as follows:

Backbone.js as our main front end MVC framework (we wouldn't be here otherwise). 
We use underscore for most of the heavy lifting that can be done clientside as we are often working with fiarly large datasets.

For the backend, we use a mixture of Node.js and PHP, depending on the project and the clients tech stack.
